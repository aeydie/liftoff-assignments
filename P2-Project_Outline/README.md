# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here - 
Have you ever wondered, "What IS there to do this weekend?" Or have you ever thought, "I am hosting this amazing event, 
but how do I get the word out?"  Our "Events" application solves these problems.  
Users are able to login and create a profile, choosing whether they would like to be an event creator or an event 
searcher.  Users that create events will be able to highlight the details of their event, such as location, date, cost, 
and any special features.  Users that wish to search for an event will be able to customize their query to their specific
wants and needs, and they will be able to view the results in a few different formats.  This will be specific to an 
individual city and it's surrounding areas.  
### Features
Include Features here -
Create Event - Users with specific authorization will be able to create events: Name, Date, Description, location, Cost
Edit Event - Users with specific authorization will be able to edit events
Search with Filter for Event - A search engine that allows for specific keywords or filters so a user can look for the vents that they are interested in.
User login + Authorization - Users will be able to create accounts (event searchers or Event planners), and log in to their type of account. Each user will have a unique profile page with their saved events or events they have created.
Favorite Events - Event searchers will be able to save and view events on their profile. (notifications will pop up for user when events are coming up - see things we have to learn).
Display Events - The user will be able to view the events according to their specific search or location. Events will be displayed in different ways, either by an interactive map or a list of events.
### Technologies
Include Technologies here - 
Java
MySql
Angular
Hibernate
Springboot
ThymeLeaf
### What I'll Have to Learn
Include what you will need to learn here -
OAuth - allow users to login user other sites like google/facebook etc. A way to use OAuth through Spring security.
Interactive Mapping API - We are looking into Google Maps API or Yelp API so a user on our app can look for events in their area
Web scraper - We are looking into implementing a web scraper to pull information from specific areas online.
Event Authentication - We are working on a way for events to be authenticated as real events before being posted, possibly by only allowing those with the correct event authorization (event creators) to create/edit events. We could have a mod system/administrator role in place to monitor events as they are posted.
Notifications - This would alert a user with a profile of upcoming events in their area. We will need to do more research in how to implement this. We would need to track date/location
